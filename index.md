## Overview
The **AI2001_Category-Source_Code-SC-Opa** repository hosts datasets related to the Opa programming language. This collection is part of the broader AI2001 project, aimed at providing resources for artificial intelligence development. The datasets included in this repository are designed for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts who want to explore the capabilities of the Opa language in the context of AI.

For the latest updates and downloads, visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/ProjectMunnoi/AI2001_Category-Source_Code-SC-Opa/releases).

## Features
- **Comprehensive Datasets**: Access a variety of datasets tailored for the Opa language.
- **Easy to Use**: The source code is structured for straightforward integration into your projects.
- **Open Source**: This repository is licensed under GPLv3, allowing for free use and modification.
- **Community Driven**: Contributions are welcome, making this a collaborative effort.

## Installation
To get started with the datasets, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ProjectMunnoi/AI2001_Category-Source_Code-SC-Opa.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd AI2001_Category-Source_Code-SC-Opa
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the necessary dependencies for the Opa language. Follow the Opa installation guide for your operating system.

4. **Download Datasets**:
   For the latest datasets, check the [Releases section](https://github.com/ProjectMunnoi/AI2001_Category-Source_Code-SC-Opa/releases) and download the files. Execute the datasets in your local environment to start using them.

## Usage
Once you have the datasets downloaded, you can start using them in your projects. Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to load a dataset in Opa:

```opa
// Load dataset
dataset = loadDataset("path/to/dataset");

// Process data
result = processData(dataset);

// Output result
print(result);
```

This example demonstrates how to load a dataset and process it using the Opa programming language. Modify the paths and functions as needed for your specific use case.

## Datasets
The repository includes various datasets that cater to different aspects of artificial intelligence and machine learning using the Opa language. Here are some of the key datasets available:

1. **Text Classification Dataset**: Contains labeled text data for training classification models.
2. **Image Recognition Dataset**: Features images and their corresponding labels for image recognition tasks.
